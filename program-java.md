## Control flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

The flow doesnt change unelss there is something there that will make it shift.
ex: someone putting in thier login information. If they don't put in the correct information, instead of it going all the way through, it'll shift and tell them that the information is incorrect.

>  Looking back at the code in the if and else sections, the lines promptUser and submitForm could also be calls to other functions in the script.

## Conditional
A condition is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not. An instruction or a set of instructions is executed if a specific condition is fulfilled

## JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is **a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
Examples:
- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

### JavaScript Function Syntax
- A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
- **Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).**

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

### JavaScript Operators
(=) assigns a value to a variable.
The addition operator (+) adds numbers
The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

-------

Operator | Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.
Example: let x = 10;
x += 5;

The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.
