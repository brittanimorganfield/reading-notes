## HTML

Structural markup: The elements that you can use to describe both heading and paragraphs
Semantic markup: provides extra information like where emphasis is placed in a sentence.

HTML has 6 types of headings from </h1> to </h6>

**The order:**

</html>

</title></title>

</head></head>

</body>

insert body stuff here

</body>

</html> 

**Code:**
(I know foward slashes don't go in the first brackets, this is for notetaking purposes only)

</h1></h1> = heading

</p></p> = paragraph

</br></br> = break

</em></em> = emphasize

</strong></strong> = bold

</b></b> = bold

</ul></ul> = unordered list

</il></il> = list item/bullet points

</ol></ol> = ordered list/numbered


## CSS

It allows you to great visually pleasing websites with HTML elements. This includes the size of text, the color, any images, etc.
> CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
