## Operators & Loops

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. 

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop. 
example: for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
