# The Coder's Computer

## notes
- avoid using text editors that don't allow you to change the presentation of your text. Whether that's bolding or using italics or changing the size and font!
> "some of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them."

## Text editors to use
Visual Studio Code has syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code completion. It can be used on any platform!
