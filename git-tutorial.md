# What is Git?
- Git is a version control system that lets multiple developers work on the same code. A history of changes to your file.
Git takes "spashots" in time and allow you to keep track of your work.

### Key code:
- git status
- git commit -a

> By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

> By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

>$ cd example
>$ git remote -v
>remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch)
>remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)
>remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch)
>remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (push)
>remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (fetch)
>remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (push)
