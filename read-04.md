# Wireframes

**Wireframing** allows you to define and plan the information hierarchy of your design for a website, app, or product.
* Before building anything with code, understand what you're doing!

Wireframes can be drawn by hand or you can use software like Invision or Balsamiq.
Hand-drawn wireframes are easier to use for beginners because htey can easily be changed

### Ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:
- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design <br>
- Sketch > Code <br>
- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code <br>
- ketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code <br>

Tools for wireframing
- UXPin
- InVision
- Wireframe.cc

Before creating you wireframe, understand who your audience is so you can design you website to benefit them most.
Understanding where they'll come from and how the pages will flow together is very important.

After creating your prototype, you can use tools like Proto.io or Adobe XD.

## Good wireframes always have these characteristics
- Clarity
- Confidence
- Simplicity

# HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content
Example: My cat is very grump vs "</p\>My cat is very grumpy</p\>"

# Semantics
> Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
Semantic elements include "h1" "article"
