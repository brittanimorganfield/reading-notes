## CSS Box Model

Boxes are sized just enough to fit whatever content is inside of it. The most common ways to size a box are with percentages and pixels.

If you have overflowing content, there's a property that tells the browser there's content inside of the box that is larger than its actual size. you can either hide the text or allow the user to scroll.

every box has 3 available properties
- Border
- Margin
- Padding

Without these things, you text would be on the edge of the box and would make it hard for users to read.
